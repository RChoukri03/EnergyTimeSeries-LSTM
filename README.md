# Predictive Electricity Consumption Models Using Recurrent Neural Networks

This repository contains the implementation and training scripts for predictive models of electricity consumption using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The models are trained on datasets from different environments such as hospitals, offices, and a combined dataset of both.

## Introduction
The primary goal of this project is to develop predictive models that can accurately forecast electricity consumption based on past data. By leveraging the capabilities of RNNs and LSTM networks, the models aim to capture temporal dependencies and recurrent patterns in the data.

The project is based on the research and development outlined in the provided PDF.
